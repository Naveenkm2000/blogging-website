And then, you see Yash’s silhouette. You’re told the Government has banned a book written on him by journalist Anand and the entire stock is burnt; one survives, and the film is about the author speaking about the man whose story was never told.

Veteran Anant Nag plays Anand, who recites poetry from his book and page numbers by rote, nearly four decades after it was banned. Listening to him is hotshot journalist Deepa (Malavika Avinash) who initially gives him half an hour, but is listening even as the end credits roll.</pre></div><img src="images/kgf2.png" id="img0.8847345049548998" onclick="clicked(img0.8847345049548998)" onerror="this.src = 'http://localhost:8000/images/kgf2.png'" style="width: 91.5%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 3.5%; margin-right: 3.5%; align-items: center; border-radius: 2%;"><div id="0.909255057547768" contenteditable="false" onclick="clicked(0.909255057547768)"><pre style=""><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 25px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></font></pre><pre style=""><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 25px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Young orphan Ramakrishna heads to Bombay from Karnataka, polishes shoes for a living and slowly grows up the ranks of the city’s underworld to become don Rocky. He gets a chance to make Bombay his, if he finishes some work in Bangalore. In between, he meets a girl (Srinidhi Shetty) and sets out to the place after which the film is named. His brief is to vanquish the enemy, but he also ends up empowering 20,000 workers.

There are scenes with great potential. In one, which also sees the heroine falling for him, Rocky stops the car in the middle of a road and helps a woman with a child pick up her bag and a bun that’s rolled off. He begins speaking about how he could buy a bun only after polishing eight pairs of shoes and how a mother is the biggest warrior of them all, and even as you wait to see if you’ll get glimpses of a tortured childhood, the scene cuts to the heroine melting for his actions.

This, after a typical hero-heroine introduction in the middle of the road (again!), where she has stalled traffic so she can party with her friends. He fights her goons, she’s miffed, but he thinks she’s lucky he’s fallen for her. “Congratulations, I love you,” he says. “How dare you,’ she replies. “How fair you,” he retorts, even as you wince. Elsewhere, the misogyny in the dialogues continue. Men are told to wear bangles twice. Rocky is dared to touch the girl in front of everyone; he does not, and the girl’s face falls. Sigh. You expect more from a film that supposedly celebrates the mother as warrior.</span></font><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 25px; white-space: pre-wrap;">
