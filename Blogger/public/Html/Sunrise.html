A set of activities you do every morning as you start your day?

For those of you whoâ€™ve taken my Anti-Procrastination Program, you know about the concept of the productivity ritual, what I call a set of activities that energizes you and helps you to achieve and maintain peak energy all day long, so that you achieve maximum productivity every day.

Part of a productivity ritual consists of a morning ritual, a set of morning activities to kick your day off to a fresh start. A morning ritual can be very simple, from a 10-minute meditation session, to a series of mundane morning tasks (like brush your teeth, wash your face, do your skincare regime), to brewing your morning tea and soaking in its aroma as you take tiny sips while reading the morning paper.</pre></div>
